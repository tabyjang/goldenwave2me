React Server Components represent a paradigm shift in how we think about React applications. Let's explore what they are and how to use them.

## What Are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that render on the server and send HTML to the client. This has several benefits:

- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Direct access to backend resources
- Improved initial page load performance

## When to Use Server Components

Server Components are ideal for:

- Data fetching components
- Static content rendering
- Components that don't need interactivity

## Client vs Server Components

Understanding when to use each type is crucial for building efficient applications. Use client components when you need interactivity, and server components for everything else.
