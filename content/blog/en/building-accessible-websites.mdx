Web accessibility ensures that websites can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. It's not just a nice-to-have—it's essential.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility benefits everyone:

- People with permanent disabilities
- Users with temporary impairments
- Users in challenging environments
- Search engine optimization

## WCAG Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for making web content accessible. Key principles include:

- Perceivable: Information must be presentable
- Operable: Interface must be navigable
- Understandable: Content must be clear
- Robust: Content must be compatible

## Testing Your Site

Use tools like Lighthouse, axe, and screen readers to test your site's accessibility.
